# xfce-animated-wallpaper
WIP. Animated 8bit background that works with xfce.

To install, you have to edit the python program's os.system statement. My directory path is listed, but yours is probably going to be a lot diffierent.

Please note that this project isn't an actuall .gif background, it's just a bunch of images that are viewed as a slideshow. Also, it's backwards. I'm working on fixing that.
